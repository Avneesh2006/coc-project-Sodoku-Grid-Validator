# coc-project-Sodoku-Grid-Validator

## Project Description
This program checks whether a completed 9x9 Sudoku puzzle is valid or not. A Sudoku solution is considered valid only if three rules are followed:
1. Every row must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repeating.
2. Every column must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repeating.
3. Each 3x3 sub-grid must also contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repeating.

The program stores the Sudoku puzzle in a 9x9 two-dimensional array and then uses separate functions to check rows, columns, and sub-grids.
